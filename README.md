# Codes for Hackathon "AI for Connectivity"
Here we perform an analysis using the open source "Ookla dataset" for internet speed comparing it with the "Giga School Connectivity Data" and check if the school is getting the internet speed that it was supposed to receive keeping OOkla data as the bench mark for camparison.

As per the analysis explained step by step in the codes using Python,
57 out of 102, which means 56% of the unique schools in GIGA data for Uzbekistan can improve their internet connectivity with very little improvement because getting upto the OOKLA speed is very much possible with very little investments or interventions
