# Codes for Hackathon "AI for Connectivity"
Here we perform an analysis using the open source "Ookla dataset" for internet speed comparing it with the "Giga School Connectivity Data" and check if the school is getting the internet speed that it was supposed to receive keeping OOkla data as the bench mark for camparison.

As per the analysis explained step by step in the codes using Python,
# 57 out of 102, which means 56% of the unique schools in GIGA data for Uzbekistan can improve their internet connectivity with very little improvement because getting upto the OOKLA speed is very much possible with very little investments or interventions

Further enhancements:

1. We can build a prediction model using AI on the performance of the school internet using more open source datasets such as ,
a) wealth_index data from Facebook
b) nighttime lights" which means electricity continuity in the area,
c) business coverage data extracting from google maps
d) road coverage in the particular location
e) population density in the particular location
f) availability of social insfrastructures like hospitals, government offices
This can provide an idea of what can be possible for the particular school. We can at first build such AI prediction model using the countires like Switzerland and other developed countries where such datasets are available and replicate the model in under developed countries to provide an investment plan for the government of underdeveloped or developing countries.

2. On top of this we can also help the government of Ubzebistan or any other country levaraging from this data to choose the right vendor of the internet provided. Based on the open data of each vendor and their performance, we can create an automation tool for the vendor selection and automate the process of procurement using AI and providing UI for the vendors to input their information and the government can directly levarage on choosing the right vendor.

3. This analysis can also be leveraged by the government to plan to create a new school or any new social infrastructure.
